This is a demonstration of an Ethereum-based resource game. The game logic lives in a smart contract on the Goerli testnet.

Contract: https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x0002bc31940420ee76ecd3091643e590679cf9e4

The frontend uses React, Chakra, useDapp, and ethers.js

This is for demonstration purposes only.
